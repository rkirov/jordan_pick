# Second-countability helpers

Point-set topology preliminaries for the Poincaré–Volterra lemma
(`Rado/Topology/PoincareVolterra.lean`):

* a compact set in a locally second-countable space is second countable;
* a countable cover by second-countable open sets gives second countability
  (set-of-sets version of `secondCountableTopology_of_countable_cover`);
* ccc: a second-countable space has no uncountable pairwise-disjoint family of
  nonempty open sets;
* countable-branching reachability is countable.

All statements are pure topology, independent of the rest of the development.
