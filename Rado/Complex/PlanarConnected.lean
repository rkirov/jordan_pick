# Planar connectivity for the standard configuration

The fixed configuration used in the main assembly: inside the ball `B(0, 8)`
we remove the two closed unit disks centered at `±4`. The remainder must be
path-connected (this feeds the clopen argument showing `Y = X ∖ (K₀ ∪ K₁)` is
connected, Anghel–Stan proof of Theorem 7, Step 0a of `Rado/PLAN.md`).

Also provided: the annuli `1 ≤ |z ∓ 4| ≤ 2` sit inside `B(0, 8)`, and related
trivial inclusions used when instantiating the configuration in a chart.
