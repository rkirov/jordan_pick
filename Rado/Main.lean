# Radó's theorem: Riemann surfaces are second countable

Target (lean-eval `rado_riemannSurface`, pure Mathlib): a connected Hausdorff
topological space with a 1-dimensional complex manifold structure has second
countable topology.

This is the exact statement of
<https://lean-lang.org/eval/problems/rado_riemannSurface/>
(submitter: Junyan Xu; source: Hubbard, *Teichmüller theory*, Vol. 1, §1.3).

The real-manifold analogue is false (Prüfer surface, long line), so the proof
must use the complex structure in an essential way.
