# `jordan_curve`

Jordan curve theorem

- Problem ID: `jordan_curve`
- Test Problem: no
- Submitter: Kim Morrison
- Notes: §48 of Knill's 'Some Fundamental Theorems in Mathematics'. Every continuous injection r : S¹ → ℝ² has a complement with exactly two connected components. Mathlib has Metric.sphere, EuclideanSpace, ConnectedComponents, and Nat.card, but no Jordan curve theorem (`grep -ri 'jordan curve' Mathlib/`: no hits), no winding numbers / invariance of domain in a form that would discharge it. Stateable with zero new definitions.
- Source: C. Jordan, *Cours d'analyse* (1887, 2nd ed.; first statement and a famously gap-laden proof). The first rigorous proof is by O. Veblen, *Theory on plane curves in non-metrical analysis situs*, Trans. AMS 6 (1905). Listed as §48 in O. Knill, *Some Fundamental Theorems in Mathematics* (https://people.math.harvard.edu/~knill/graphgeometry/papers/fundamental.pdf). Formalized in Mizar (Korniłowicz et al., 2005) and HOL Light (Hales, 2007); not in Lean or Coq mathlib-equivalents.
- Informal solution: Modern proofs use either singular homology of the complement (Alexander duality H̃_0(ℝ² ∖ C) ≅ H̃¹(S¹) = ℤ giving exactly two components) or planar combinatorics (approximate by polygonal Jordan curves, use winding-number parity to define inside/outside, transfer to the continuous curve via uniform convergence).

Do not modify `Challenge.lean` or `Solution.lean`. Those files are part of the
trusted benchmark and fixed by the repository.

Write your solution in `Submission.lean` and any additional local modules under
`Submission/`.

Participants may use Mathlib freely. Any helper code not already available in
Mathlib must be inlined into the submission workspace.

Multi-file submissions are allowed through `Submission.lean` and additional local
modules under `Submission/`.

`lake test` runs comparator for this problem. The command expects a comparator
binary in `PATH`, or in the `COMPARATOR_BIN` environment variable.
