# The Poincaré–Volterra lemma

If `Z` is a connected, Hausdorff, locally compact, locally connected, locally
second-countable topological space and `f : Z → Y` is a continuous map into a
second-countable Hausdorff space whose fibers are discrete, then `Z` is second
countable.

This is the purely topological endgame of Radó's theorem; see Forster,
*Lectures on Riemann Surfaces*, Lemma 23.2 (= Rainer's notes 23.2, full proof
in `reference/rado/rainer.txt`), or Anghel–Stan arXiv:2008.12189, Appendix C.

Proof sketch. Let `V` be a countable basis of `Y` and let `𝒰` be the family of
all connected components `U` of preimages `f ⁻¹' V`, `V ∈ V`, such that `U` is
second countable (as a subspace). Then:

1. `𝒰` covers `Z`: given `z`, discreteness of the fiber through `z`, local
   compactness and local second countability give a relatively compact open
   `W ∋ z` with second-countable compact closure and
   `closure W ∩ f ⁻¹' {f z} = {z}`; pick `V ∈ V` with
   `f z ∈ V ⊆ Y \ f '' (frontier W)` (the image of the frontier is compact,
   hence closed, and misses `f z`); the component `U ∋ z` of `f ⁻¹' V` avoids
   `frontier W`, meets `W`, hence `U ⊆ W` (connectedness), so `U` is second
   countable, open (local connectedness), and `U ∈ 𝒰`.
2. Each `U₀ ∈ 𝒰` meets only countably many members of `𝒰`: for fixed `V`, the
   components of `f ⁻¹' V` are pairwise disjoint, so those meeting `U₀` trace a
   pairwise-disjoint family of nonempty opens in the second-countable `U₀`
   (ccc), countable; sum over the countable basis.
3. Chain argument: the members reachable from a fixed `U₀ ∈ 𝒰` by finite chains
   form a countable subfamily `R` whose union `G` is open; `G` is also closed
   (a boundary point `z` lies in some `U ∈ 𝒰` by 1, which meets `G`, hence is
   reachable, hence `z ∈ G`); connectedness gives `G = Z`, so countably many
   second-countable open sets cover `Z`.
