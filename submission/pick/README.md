# `pick`

Pick's theorem

- Problem ID: `pick`
- Test Problem: no
- Submitter: Kim Morrison
- Notes: A simple lattice polygon with n ≥ 3 vertices has area I + B/2 − 1, with I/B the interior/boundary lattice-point counts. Trusted helpers (toPlane, latPoly, inside, area, Adjacent, IsSimple, boundaryPts, interiorPts) are non-holes; the simplicity hypothesis is mandatory (the formula is false for self-intersecting polygons). Mathlib has Polygon and its boundary but no polygon interior, lattice counts, or Pick's theorem (formalized in Isabelle/HOL but not Lean). Candidate from §154 of the Knill survey.

- Informal solution: Additivity + triangulation. Pick's measure P(poly) = I + B/2 − 1 is additive when gluing polygons along an edge (shared boundary points are double-counted as boundary then become interior, and the −1 terms combine correctly). Triangulate the simple polygon into lattice triangles; reduce to elementary (no interior/edge lattice points) triangles, each of area 1/2 with P = 0 + 3/2 − 1 = 1/2. Since both area and P are additive over the triangulation and agree on elementary triangles, they agree on the polygon. Requires the lattice triangulation + additivity machinery, absent from Mathlib.

Do not modify `Challenge.lean` or `Solution.lean`. Those files are part of the
trusted benchmark and fixed by the repository.

Write your solution in `Submission.lean` and any additional local modules under
`Submission/`.

Participants may use Mathlib freely. Any helper code not already available in
Mathlib must be inlined into the submission workspace.

Multi-file submissions are allowed through `Submission.lean` and additional local
modules under `Submission/`.

`lake test` runs comparator for this problem. The command expects a comparator
binary in `PATH`, or in the `COMPARATOR_BIN` environment variable.

## Solver submission notes

Everything above the divider is the trusted lean-eval problem README. The rest
of this note documents our solver-owned bundle.

Trusted files (fetched verbatim from `leanprover/lean-eval`, `generated/pick/`,
do not modify): `Challenge.lean`, `ChallengeDeps.lean`, `Solution.lean`,
`WorkspaceTest.lean`, `config.json`, `holes.json`, `lakefile.toml`,
`lean-toolchain`. `ChallengeDeps.lean` provides the 8 trusted helper
definitions (`toPlane`, `latPoly`, `inside`, `area`, `Adjacent`, `IsSimple`,
`boundaryPts`, `interiorPts`) in `namespace LeanEval.Geometry.PicksTheorem`.

Solver-owned files:

- `Submission.lean` restates the benchmark theorem in `namespace Submission`
  and delegates to our proof `LeanEval.Geometry.PicksTheorem.pick`.
- `Submission/` is our Pick development, re-rooted from
  `JordanPick.PicksTheorem.*` to `Submission.*`. It is the import-closure of
  `EvalBridgeMain`: `Defs`, `Winding`, `Area`, `Weight`, `PerEdge`, `Jordan`,
  `Pick`, the `Pick/` subdirectory (`Reductions`, `Alternation`, `Corners`,
  `BoundaryArcs`, `Slab`, `Routing`, `EarClip`), and the bridge files
  (`EvalBridge`, `EvalBridgeBoundary`, `EvalBridgeInside`, `EvalBridgeSimple`,
  `EvalBridgeReverse`, `EvalBridgeMain`).

The only edit relative to the main development: `Submission/EvalBridge.lean`
gains `import ChallengeDeps` and drops its own byte-identical copy of the 8
trusted helper definitions, so they resolve to the trusted `ChallengeDeps`
versions.

`Submission.pick` is axiom-clean: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.
