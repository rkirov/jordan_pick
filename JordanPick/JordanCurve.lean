# The (continuous) Jordan Curve Theorem, via Brouwer — Maehara's proof

Target (lean-eval `jordan_curve`, pure Mathlib): a continuous injection
`r : S¹ → ℝ²` has a complement with exactly two connected components.

**Strategy (Maehara, *The Jordan curve theorem via the Brouwer fixed point
theorem*, Amer. Math. Monthly 1984).** Reduce to the Brouwer fixed point theorem,
taken here as an explicit interface `BrouwerFPT` (to be discharged from upstream
Mathlib — PR #36770 is landing Brouwer — or built separately). The reduction uses:

* **Lemma 2 (crossing)** — two transversal paths in a rectangle must meet; proved
  directly from Brouwer via an explicit map of the square to its boundary.
* **Lemma 1** — if `ℝ²∖J` is disconnected, each component has `J` as its
  boundary; via the Tietze extension theorem + Brouwer.
* **Main construction** — using the farthest pair `a,b ∈ J` and the points
  `l,m,p,q` on a vertical segment, show `ℝ²∖J` has exactly one bounded component;
  with the unique unbounded component that gives exactly two.

work-in-progress with `sorry`s); build it explicitly with
`lake build JordanPick.JordanCurve`.

`[a,b]×[c,d]`, one running from the left edge to the right edge (`h`), the other
from the bottom edge to the top edge (`v`), must meet. Proved directly from
Brouwer: if they were disjoint, the explicit normalized map
`F(s,t) = ((v₁ t − h₁ s)/N, (h₂ s − v₂ t)/N)` (with `N` the sup-norm of
`h s − v t`) sends the parameter square `[-1,1]²` to its boundary with no fixed
point. Coordinates are `p 0`, `p 1` of `p : Plane`. -/

/-! ### Foundational topology of a Jordan curve `J = range r`

A Jordan curve is `J = range r` for `r : S¹ → ℝ²` continuous and injective. Here we
collect the purely topological facts about `J` and its complement that Maehara's
argument needs, independent of Brouwer:

* `J` is compact and closed, its complement `Jᶜ` is open (tasks 1-2);
* `r` is a (closed) embedding, so `J ≃ₜ S¹` (task 3);
* `Jᶜ` has exactly one unbounded connected component (PRELIM (a));
* each connected component of `Jᶜ` is open and path-connected (PRELIM (b)).

/-- **Maehara's Lemma 1 core: "an arc does not separate the plane".** If `A ⊆ ℝ²`
is an arc (homeomorphic to the unit interval `[0,1]`) then its complement `Aᶜ` is
connected.

Proof (Brouwer + Tietze). If `Aᶜ` were disconnected it would have a bounded
component (there is a unique unbounded one, containing the cobounded exterior of a
disc through `A`); pick a point `o` in it. Since `A ≃ₜ [0,1]` and `[0,1]` is an
absolute retract (`TietzeExtension`), the identity `A → A` extends to a retraction
`ρ : ℝ² → A`. Glue `ρ` on the component `K ∋ o` with the identity elsewhere: the two
pieces agree on `frontier K ⊆ A` where `ρ = id`, giving a continuous
`Q : ℝ² → ℝ²∖{o}` that is the identity outside `K`. On a large disc `D = closedBall o R`
containing `A` and `K`, the map `z ↦ o - R·(Q z - o)/‖Q z - o‖` (antipodal radial
projection about `o`) is a fixed-point-free continuous self-map of `D`, contradicting
Brouwer. -/

/-- **Maehara's Lemma 1.** If `ℝ²∖J` is disconnected, each component has the whole
Jordan curve `J = range r` as its boundary. We state (and prove) the sharper
unconditional form: for any `x` in the complement, the frontier of its connected
component equals `range r`.

Proof (arc argument, via `arc_not_separates`). Write `U` for the component of `x`.
Always `frontier U ⊆ range r` (a boundary point outside the curve would lie in some
component of the open complement, forcing it into `U` — impossible for a frontier
point). If `frontier U ⊊ range r`, transport the proper closed set
`C = r⁻¹(frontier U) ⊊ S¹` to a proper closed arc `A₀` (via `exists_proper_arc`) and
push forward to `A = r '' A₀`, a proper arc with `frontier U ⊆ A ⊊ range r`. Then
`Aᶜ` is connected (`arc_not_separates`), yet `U` and `(closure U)ᶜ` split it into two
nonempty relatively open pieces (`x ∈ U`; a point of `range r ∖ A` lies in
`(closure U)ᶜ`) — contradicting connectedness. -/

`b ↦ !₂[1,0]`, scaling every distance by the fixed factor `2 / dist a b`.  This
reduces the geometric core (`step_A`, `step_B`) to *normalized* statements in which

rectangle's bottom edge), the axis segment from the interior point `m ∈ J_n` down to

`J_s`, the concatenation `s → m` (axis), `m → l` (a path inside `J_n \ {a,b}`),
`l → n` (axis, `n = !₂[0,2]`) would give a bottom-to-top path in the rectangle
avoiding `J_s`, contradicting `vertical_meets_arc` (`J_s` joins `a` to `b`).  The

* `m` — the lowest point of `J_n` on the axis;
* `p` — the highest point of `J_s` on the axis lying at or below `m` (the top of the

/-- The Jordan curve theorem reduced to Brouwer (Maehara). The eval `jordan_curve`
follows by discharging `BrouwerFPT`. Given the two geometric core facts — existence
(`step_A_exists_bounded`) and uniqueness (`step_B_bounded_unique`) of a bounded
component — together with the unique unbounded component (`exists_unbounded_component`,
`unbounded_component_unique`), the complement has exactly two components. -/
